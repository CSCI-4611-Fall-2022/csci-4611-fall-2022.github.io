title: "Welcome to CSCI 4611!"
---

Welcome to the Fall 2022 offering of Programming Interactive Computer Graphics and Games at the University of Minnesota!  The following describes the various tools we will be using this semester:

- The [course website](https://csci-4611-fall-2022.github.io/) will be your main access point for public course information and content, including slides, lecture videos, and example code.
- [Canvas](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/333005) will be used for posting grades and distributing internal-only announcements.
- Programming assignments will be posted on [GitHub](https://github.com/CSCI-4611-Fall-2022).  We will be using GitHub classroom for checking out and submitting assignment code.
- [Piazza](https://piazza.com/umn/fall2022/csci4611) will be used for posting questions about the course and will be closely monitored by the TAs.  If you need help with a programming assignment, this is the first place you should go.
- [Slack](https://csci4611.slack.com/) will be the primary platform for synchronous communication.  This should generally be used when your question is not appropriate for posting on Piazza or you need to privately ask the instructor a question.

If you have any questions about the course structure, please review the [syllabus](/syllabus) first and then feel free to contact me if the answer is not already posted there.
