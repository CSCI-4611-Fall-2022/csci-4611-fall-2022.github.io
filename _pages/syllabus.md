## Course Overview

Computer graphics is an exciting field within computer science that has seen dramatic recent growth. The impact of graphics on our culture and on our daily lives is far-reaching, as we can see through applications in art, design, education, games, movies, science, and medicine. This course covers the tools and techniques used today for programming games and other interactive computer graphics applications. Some of the core concepts covered include: interactive 2D/3D graphics, physical simulation, polygonal modeling, texture mapping, character animation, illumination models, shader programming, and ray casting. This is a programming-heavy course, and assignments will be implemented in TypeScript using a high-level graphics toolkit built on top of WebGL. 

## Learning Objectives

In this course, you will learn to:
- Understand basic concepts and algorithms relevant to computer graphics programming.
- Identify, define, and solve 2D and 3D graphics programming problems.
- Program real-time computer graphics using a high-level scene graph library.
- Write shader programs that run on the graphics processing unit (GPU).
- Implement user interfaces for interaction with 3D graphics applications.

## Prerequisites
